- 🧠 **Learn how LLM-based testing differs from traditional software testing** and implement rules-based testing to assess your LLM application.
- 🛠️ **Build model-graded evaluations** to test your LLM application using an evaluation LLM.
- ⚙️ **Automate your evals (rules-based and model-graded)** using continuous integration tools from CircleCI.


## What I Learned in This Course

- 🌟 **Created a Continuous Integration (CI) Workflow**: I learned how to create a continuous integration workflow to evaluate LLM applications at every change, leading to faster, safer, and more efficient application development.

- 🤖 **Dealing with Unpredictable Model Behavior**: Understanding that generative AI model behavior is less predictable than traditional software, I grasped the importance of systematic testing to save development time and cost.

- 🔍 **Continuous Integration in LLMOps**: I learned that continuous integration, a key part of LLMOps, involves making small changes to software in development and thoroughly testing them. This approach helps catch issues early when they are easier to fix.

- 🛠️ **Robust Automated Testing Pipeline**: I mastered building a robust automated testing pipeline, allowing for the isolation of bugs before they accumulate – making them easier and less costly to fix. This enabled the team to focus on building new features, iterating, and shipping products faster.

### Skills Acquired

- 📝 **Writing Robust LLM Evaluations**: I learned to write robust LLM evaluations to cover common problems like hallucinations, data drift, and harmful or offensive output.

- 🚀 **Building CI Workflow for Automatic Evaluations**: I developed the skills to build a continuous integration workflow that automatically evaluates every change to an application.

- 🎭 **Orchestrating CI Workflow**: I gained experience in orchestrating CI workflows to run specific evaluations at different stages of development.
